To study the flow of traffic, identify crucial elements such as cars, traffic lights and other elements for automated survelience. The code uses basics of OpenCv and numpy to identify traffic lights. Haarcascade classification is used to identify cars.



## Code implementation

This is a simple environment requiring opencv and the haarcascade_cars.xml file. 

The haarcascade file can be downloaded from [clicking here](media/haarcascade_car.xml)

To install the opencv use the following command

```python
